# Horizontal Scroll Gallery | V2

A clean, lightweight gallery with a twist — instead of the usual vertical scroll, this project goes sideways. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, this gallery presents images in a horizontal scrolling container, offering an elegant, unconventional browsing experience.

This is **Version 2**, so expect a raw, functional base with room to grow. No unnecessary libraries, no bloated code — just the essentials.



## 🔧 Improvements from V2

Revamped visual style with fresh, modern color. now featuring smooth linear gradients for a more dynamic and appealing look.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore horizontal scrolling in a simple, focused way. It’s great for image portfolios, product showcases, or creative landing pages where a horizontal layout adds uniqueness.

Whether you're learning how to manipulate scroll behavior, building something minimal, or experimenting with a design-forward interface, this project gives you a solid foundation.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Displays a series of images inside a horizontally scrollable container.
- Allows scrolling using the mouse wheel (on desktops) or swipe gestures (on touch devices).
- Uses native browser scrolling with smooth behavior.
- Fully responsive, so it adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The gallery is a flex container with `overflow-x: scroll`, causing items to line up horizontally and scroll along the X-axis.
- JavaScript is optionally used to enhance scroll behavior (e.g., allowing vertical wheel gestures to scroll horizontally).
- CSS keeps the layout clean and smooth, using flexbox and minimal styling.

## 🖼️ Design Notes

> V1 is minimal and functional — think of it as a skeleton for bigger ideas.

- The current design is basic and intentionally unstyled.
- You can easily extend it by:
  - Adding image hover effects
  - Using CSS grid or scroll snapping
  - Styling the scrollbar or hiding it for aesthetics
  - Embedding captions or overlay info

**Modern design and polish are coming in future versions.**
